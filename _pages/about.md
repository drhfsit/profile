:crystal_ball: Bio
-----
I am an independent researcher, clinical psychologist, and registered psychotherapist based in Macao. My research interests lie in common mental health disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety) and sleep health among vulnerable populations (e.g., adolescents, caregivers) and mental health interventions. In clinical practice, I provide assessment and evidence-based interventions for individuals with mental health challenges.
